# 🛡️ Security & Audits

Trust and transparency are the cornerstones of the Pepulla project. We are committed to implementing the highest security standards to protect our community and their assets.

### Smart Contract Integrity

-   **🔒 Fixed Total Supply**: A total of 88 billion $PULA tokens will be created. The minting function will be permanently disabled, ensuring no new tokens can ever be created.
-   **📜 ERC-20 Standard**: $PULA is a standard ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, ensuring broad compatibility and security.
-   **🔍 Third-Party Audit**: The $PULA smart contract will undergo a full audit by a reputable third-party security firm before the Token Generation Event (TGE). The full audit report will be made public for everyone to review.

### Platform Security

The Pepulla Aggregator platform is built with best-in-class web security standards.

-   **Your keys, your crypto.** The platform will **never** have access to your private keys or assets. Wallet connections are for verification purposes only (to check for $PULA holdings).
-   We are committed to full transparency with our community. No rugs here, just rockets! 🚀
