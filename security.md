# 🛡️ Security & Audits

Trust and transparency are the cornerstones of the Pepulla project. We are committed to implementing the highest security standards to protect our community and their assets.

### Smart Contract Integrity

* **🔒 Fixed Total Supply**: A total of 88 billion $PULA tokens will be created. The minting function will be permanently disabled, ensuring no new tokens can ever be created.
* **📜 ERC-20 Standard**: $PULA is a standard ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, ensuring broad compatibility and security.
*   **Security Status:&#x20;**<mark style="color:green;">**PASSED**</mark> ✔

### Platform Security

The Pepulla Aggregator platform is built with best-in-class web security standards.

* **Your keys, your crypto.** The platform will **never** have access to your private keys or assets. Wallet connections are for verification purposes only (to check for $PULA holdings).
* We are committed to full transparency with our community. No rugs here, just rockets! 🚀
