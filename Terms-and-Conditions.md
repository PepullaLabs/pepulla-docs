### **Acknowledgment of Risk & No Guarantee of Profit **

The Pepulla Labs team is relentlessly committed to developing a powerful, professional, and industry-leading intelligence platform to empower meme coin traders. Our goal is to build a long-term, valuable project with a strong community and to help users navigate a market filled with risks like "rug pulls" and scams.

However, in the spirit of full transparency, we must clearly state the inherent realities of the cryptocurrency market. Your participation in our project is subject to the following understanding:

**1. Sole Responsibility:** The responsibility for any financial decision, including the purchase of $PULA tokens, rests **solely and entirely with you, the purchaser.** We are not financial advisors, and nothing on our website or in our documents constitutes financial advice.

**2. High Risk of Loss:** Investing in meme coins and cryptocurrency projects carries a high level of risk and is speculative in nature. Market conditions are volatile and unpredictable. **We provide absolutely no guarantee of profit or future value.** It is entirely possible that the value of $PULA may decrease, and you could lose your entire investment.

**3. Do Your Own Research (DYOR):** You must conduct your own thorough research and risk assessment before making any purchase. Do not invest more than you are willing to lose.

**4. Acceptance of Terms:** Your participation in the presale and/or purchase of $PULA tokens from any source constitutes your **explicit acknowledgment and full acceptance of these risks and terms.**

These points are not meant to discourage but to educate. We believe a strong community is an informed community.
