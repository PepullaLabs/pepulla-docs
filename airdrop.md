# 🎉 Airdrop

You better believe it! At Pepulla, we believe in rewarding our most active and loyal supporters who help build the project from the ground up.

A full **5% of the total token supply** (<mark style="color:blue;">4,400,000,000</mark> `$PULA`) is allocated to community airdrops.

### How to Be Eligible?

The exact criteria will be announced closer to the TGE, but rewards will be focused on:

* **Early Supporters**: Participating in the presale and being active from day one.
* **Community Engagement**: Being an active and helpful member in our Telegram and X (Twitter) communities.
* **Platform Testers**: Participating in our Beta testing phases.

**Stay active, stay engaged, and get ready for rewards!**

#### ⚠️ Important Anti-Bot Policy

To ensure fair distribution to REAL users, our Airdrop is **Activity-Based**. Simply following us is not enough. You will need to interact with our platform or Telegram bot to qualify. We ban farmers and reward true community members.
